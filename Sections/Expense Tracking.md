## Expense Tracking API

The Expense tracking API allows you to access and manipulate expense entries in similar fashion to using the weekly expensesheet view. This allows developers to create lightweight clients or widgets to track expenses beyond directly interacting with Harvest through the web browser.

```xml

  <project-id type="integer">2</project-id>
  <expense-category-id type="integer">1</expense-category-id>
    <!-- If true, expense can be invoiced. If false, expense cannot be invoiced. -->
  <billable type="boolean">true</billable>
  <spent-at type="date">2008-02-10</spent-at>
</expense>
```

Authorization: Basic (insert your authentication string here)
Content-Length: 47899

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="expense[receipt]"; filename="hotel.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

#{ BINARY IMAGE DATA }

```

## GET A RECEIPT IMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXPENSE

GET `/expenses/#{expense_id}/receipt`

Perform a simple GET on the receipt URL to receive the image data.

## WORKING WITH EXPENSES FOR OTHER USERS

You may add an of_user=#{user_id} parameter to the URL of any expense tracking API call to work with the timesheet of another user. The authenticating user must be an administrator for this to work.

## WORKING WITH LOCKED EXPENSES

Administrators may edit and delete locked expenses. The following fields are considered readonly on locked expenses: project_id, expense_category_id, spent_at.
