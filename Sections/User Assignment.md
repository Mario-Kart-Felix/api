## ASSIGN A USER TO A PROJECT

POST `/projects/#{project_id}/user_assignments`

HTTP Response: 201 Created

Location: /projects/#{project_id}/user_assignments/#{new_user_assignment_id}

You will have to post the following:

```xml
<user>
  <id type="integer">23445</id>
</user>
```

## REMOVING A USER FROM A PROJECT

DELETE `/projects/#{project_id}/user_assignments/#{user_assignment_id}`

HTTP Response: 200 OK

Note that if the user has recorded hours against the project Harvest will archive the assignment record instead of deleting it. From the end result there is no difference between archiving or deletion, but if you need to make a difference Harvest will reply with a custom Hint header if deletion did not occur.

HTTP Response: 200 OK
