## ASSIGN A TASK TO A PROJECT

POST `/projects/#{project_id}/task_assignments`

HTTP Response: 201 Created
Location: /projects/#{project_id}/task_assignments/#{new_task_assignment_id}

You will have to post the following:

```xml
<task>
  <id type="integer">653425</id>
</task>
```

## CREATE A NEW TASK AND ASSIGN IT TO A PROJECT

POST `/projects/#{project_id}/task_assignments/add_with_create_new_task`

## REMOVING A TASK FROM A PROJECT

DELETE `/projects/#{project_id}/task_assignments/#{task_assignment_id}`

HTTP Response: 200 OK

Harvest will not remove the task if it has recorded hours against the project. Instead we will archive the assignment. Harvest will reply with a custom Hint header if archiving occurred.
